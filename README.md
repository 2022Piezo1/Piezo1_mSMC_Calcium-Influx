# Piezo1_mSMC_Calcium-Influx

This code was written using a student license for MATLAB 2020a and installation instructions can be found through MathWorks website. The Symbolic Math Toolbox will also need to be downloaded after MATLAB is installed. The file can then be added to MATLAB pathway and opened in editor for use. 

The key operations of the code are identifying peaks in mSMC calcium influx signaling. First, the baseline is identified through manual input or by calculating the lowest average after dividing the curve into small segments, see Installation/use instructions for more details. Next, a multiplier is used to mark a threshold where data points above this threshold are filtered using loops to find peaks. Datapoints left and right of peak datapoint are filtered using loop conditions to estimate where peak bases are. Peaks, peak bases, and baselines are graphed in a figure for confirmation. All data points are saved in separate arrays where they can be used to calculate the intensity change, time between calcium spikes, time duration of peaks, frequency, and roughly estimate the area under the curve. This code is best used for calcium curves with low background noise and relatively cleaner curves. Messier curves or curves with sloping baselines might require manual deletion/manipulation of data points from the original curve without biasing the final calculated variables.
